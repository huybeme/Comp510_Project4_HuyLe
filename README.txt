Project 2) Write a an API driven site that you host yourself (you can’t use something like
rapidapi to host it). Your program needs to read the “games-features.xlsx” file and store all the
data into a sqlite3 database. (you can set this up as a separate mini-program that you usually
only run once). Once the data is in the database, design a simple API which will allow users to
search on a game and will return the game’s database entry as a json response.
